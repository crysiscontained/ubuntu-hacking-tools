A quick script to install some hacking tools for
a fresh install of Ubuntu.
Whilst I don't intend for complete newbies to Linux
or hacking to use it, it is newbie friendly.

if the script doesn't run then just open the directory in
terminal and type or copy and paste:
sudo chmod 755 ./ToolsInstall.sh

If you already have Golang installed and it is not at least
version 1.18.1 please remove go as the script will look for where that version is supposed to be.

Some dependencies you may have to resolve yourself (IE rubygems)

Tools list as follows:
nmap
netcat
awscli
chromium
JSParser
Sublist3r
teh_s3_bucketeers
wpscan
dirsearch
lazys3
virtual host discovery
sqlmap
knock.py
massdns
anslookup
httprobe
aquatone
unfurl
waybackurls
crtndstry
SecLists
JohntheRipper
ffuf
Gobuster
feroxbuster
searchsploit
impacket
Metasploit
thc-hydra
zaproxy

Make sure to visit each of these tools githubs if you aren't
familiar with them and view their documentation. Rockyou is
another good wordlist for random things or going through
tryhackme/hackthebox. I didn't include it because it's
unlikely that you can use it in the wild.
